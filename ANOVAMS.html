    <h1>What is Mean of Squares?</h1>
    <p>Mean squares are the sum of squares divided by the degrees of freedom. In ANOVA, Mean Squares are used to estimate the variance within the groups and between the groups. Mean Squares are calculated by dividing the sum of squares by the degrees of freedom. Mean Squares within groups (MSW) estimate the variance within the groups, while Mean Squares between groups (MSB) estimate the variance between the groups. The Mean Squares within groups (MSW) estimate the variance within the groups, while the Mean Squares between groups (MSB) estimate the variance between the groups. If the MSB is significantly larger than MSW, it indicates that there is a significant difference between the groups. On the other hand, if the MSW is larger than MSB, it indicates that there is no significant difference between the groups. Variance is a measure of how spread out a set of data is. It is calculated by finding the average of the squared differences of each value from the mean. A high variance indicates that the data is spread out, while a low variance indicates that the data is closely clustered around the mean. Variance is an important concept in ANOVA, as it is used to calculate the F-statistic, which is used to test the significance of the differences between groups.</p>
    <h1>Why do we use Mean of Squares?</h1>
    <p>Mean squares are a way of measuring the variability of the data around the mean. They are calculated by dividing the sum of squares by the degrees of freedom. Mean squares are used in ANOVA to calculate the F-statistic, which is used to test the significance of the differences between groups. The mean square error (MSE) is used to estimate the variance of the population from which the sample was drawn.</p>
    <h1>How do we calculate Mean of Squares?</h1>
    <p>Mean of Squares(Between The Groups)=Sum of Squares(Between The Groups)/Degrees of Freedom(Between The Groups). Mean of Squares(Within The Groups)=Sum of Squares(Within The Groups)/Degrees of Freedom(Within The Groups).</p>
